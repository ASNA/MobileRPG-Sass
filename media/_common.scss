/*  Media queries
    ==========================================================================

    Media queries allow content rendering to adapt to conditions such
    as device orientation and device pixel ratio. Some of these conditions
    (or features) may dynamically change, for example, when a Mobile 
    device is rotated.

    In general, we may want to leave the Desktop Browser unchanged - since it
    uses a mouse pointer as the default input device (highest pointing precision)
    and orientation does not change.

    For mobile devices, depending on their device size, we may want to adjust
    the height of some web controls and/or adjust some font metrics. (More 
    advanced adjustments - outside this project - would include hiding some 
    sections of the UI when the dimension of a mobile device is too small.)

    One possible design guideline is Apple’s recommendations
    regarding "Adaptability and Layout", described in the following document:
    
 https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/LayoutandAppearance.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH54-SW1

    In a nutshell, mobile devices are classified as having either "Regular"
    or "Compact" dimensions, both vertically and horizontally. Different phones
    or tablets present different combinations of "size classes" depending
    on the device model (physical dimensions) and the current orientation.
    (Android devices could also be categorized in the same fashion.)

    For the purpose of the default MobileRPG-Saas project, we are identifying
    devices which have "Regular Height", such that we can increase the size of some web
    controls, such as the DdsBar, and use a larger font on other controls.

    In the case of Apple devices, the only models that present "Regular Height"
    are the iPads.

    Identifying devices using Media queries, is - unfortunately - tricky, 
    because there is no consensus on basic feature reporting amongst the device
    manufacturers; for example, some Android devices report device-width
    and device-height switched when orientation changes, other devices report
    "points" instead of "pixels". Media queries support testing for ranges
    of feature-values, which, if there was consistency amongst manufacturers
    with would be the best test to apply. Unfortunately, it is currently
    unreliable. 

    At the time of this writing, there are a very few mobile devices
    that report "Regular Height". We therefore provide a reliable Media
    query check for such devices.

    Note:

    You should take an inventory of the devices to be used on your particular
    website and enable @import entries in the list that follows (and/or
    un-comment rules provided in the Saas files in folder "media").

    If you have users with devices not included in this MobileRPG-Sass project,
    you can add more @media blocks, and retrieve the media features and
    values that the new devices respond to. A very valuable tool ASNA
    recommends can be found following the link:
